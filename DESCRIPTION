Title: Method for scalable identification of spatially variable genes (SVGs) in 
    spatially resolved transcriptomics data
Description: Method for scalable identification of spatially variable genes 
    (SVGs) in spatially resolved transcriptomics data. This method is based on 
    nearest neighbor Gaussian processes (Datta et al. 2016) and uses the BRISC 
    algorithm (Saha and Datta 2018). The method scales linearly in the number 
    of spatial coordinates, and can be applied to datasets containing thousands 
    of spatial coordinates.
